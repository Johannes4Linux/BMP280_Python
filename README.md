# BMP280_Python

This script is just for demonstration purpose how to read the temperature out of a BMP280 sensor. It should explain how to configure the memory space of the sensor using I2C and how to read and understand the datasheet. It was created for a YouTube video, where I explain the details. [Here is a link to the video.](https://youtu.be/j_ulsIMLq_s)

If you are looking for a library to read out the BMP280 Sensor, please go with something more advanced and better tested, like the offical Adafruit library for the BMP280 Sensor: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BMP280
